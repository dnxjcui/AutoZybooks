#### Description: 
The purpose of this program is to rid my personal world of tedious and simple programming assignments. This program made my life a lot easier in my CS classes, and allowed me to avoid a lot of the busywork that I already understood how to do.

My CS professor allowed the use of this program by me, myself, and only I. That being said, if I get audited by somebody and they want to use it as well, I give them all the rights to do so. Just make sure you don't also go to Vanderbilt and I'm sure I won't have any repercussions.

Alright, enough talk.

##### Instructions
First and foremost, this program is only made for Google Chrome. Make sure a [chrome web driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) of the right version is installed. The version of Chrome can be determined by visiting your Chrome settings and clicking on ["About](chrome://settings/help).

Instructions are as follows: simply input Zybooks username, password, and class link into login_info.txt, in that order. Make sure to keep the username as the first line, the password as the second, and the link as the third.
The program will **only be effective** for Zybooks classes with an excessive amount of **participation multiple choice** and **animation type questions**. Don't expect the program to do any less or any more. It is simply _meant to cut out the tedious activities_. Again, before using the program, make sure that the multiple choice questions are **participation** and **_not graded on accuracy_**. The program simply does guess and check; it will not be able to answer your questions correctly on the first attempt consistently.
The program **will** time out _a lot_. I have no clue as to why, but sometimes the pages simply do not want to load. If it times out, simply try again. It will work eventually. Also, when it finishes running, it should just open back up to the Zybooks page. Simply close the browser when done. 

If for some reason, you'd like to run a test version of it, where it answers previously answered questions again just for fun, run the program with -t in the command line.
